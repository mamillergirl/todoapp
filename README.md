# Todo List Application

This Todo List application is a simple task management tool built with Ruby on Rails. It allows users to create, edit, delete, and mark tasks as completed. Additionally, tasks can be sorted based on various criteria.  This project was my first experience working with Ruby and Ruby on Rails.
