Sure, here's a basic README.md file with instructions on how to run your Ruby on Rails Todo List application locally:

```markdown
# Todo List Application

This is a simple Todo List application built with Ruby on Rails.

## Prerequisites

Before running the application locally, make sure you have the following installed:

- Ruby (version 3.3.0 or higher)
- Rails (version 7.1.3.2 or higher)
- SQLite (or any other supported database)

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone <repository_url>
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd todo-list-application
   ```

3. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   bundle install
   ```

4. Set up the database:

   ```bash
   rails db:create
   rails db:migrate
   ```

## Running the Application

To run the application locally, use the following command:

```bash
rails server
```

This will start the server locally, and you can access the application at http://localhost:3000 in your web browser.

## Usage

Once the application is running, you can:

- View the list of tasks
- Add new tasks
- Edit existing tasks
- Delete tasks
- Mark tasks as completed
- Sort Tasks
